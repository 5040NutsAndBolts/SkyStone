       TODO: Not only would it record the driving, it would record velocities at a faster speed
        which could be converted into bias and turning speeds
       TODO: (Possibly) create a new turning algorithm that better works with the recorded turning
       TODO: Implement a checkpoint system where the robot knows to pause the pursuit and activate
        certain mechanisms or do other tasks
       TODO: Options for how to get checkpoints:
         - Robot has a circle and checkPOINTS need to enter them
         - Robot has a circle and the checkpoint is a circle, they need to intersect
         - Robot has a single point and checkpoints have a radius the robot needs to enter
       TODO: Write all recording data to a human-readable file which can be edited in case we messed
        up a certain points or want to adjust the data in anyway
       TODO: Section off the field into certain parts which will have their own Pursuit and certain
        ways it needs to do something
